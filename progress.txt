11th June, 2016 - Commencing experiments on RPM Calculator
12th June, 2016 - Concluded fluctuations in RPM w.r.t. QEI frequency
13th June, 2016 - Comparision of Kiel code and CCS code about QEI fluctuation
		- PWM vs RPM (tachometer and QEI) at 10Hz and 40Hz plots
		- Going to start experiments with PWM frequency for a linear RPM vs PWM plot 
		- Completed experiment on affect of PWM frequency on PWM vs RPM plot
14th June, 2016 - Commenced experiments on motor characteristics.
		- Coupled a dc motor to pedestal bearing and used it as a dc generator to supply load to motor
		- Plotted graphs and analaysed the data and concluded in the Excel Sheet
15th June, 2016 - Commencing hysteresis study and reviewing all experiments
		- Retested RPM vs PWM plots
16th June, 2016 - Updated Code for the two wheel controlling Tiva. Added a control loop to third wheel on which hysteresis will be studied.
